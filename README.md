# WebTechnologies-LLSIF (Love Live School Idol Festival)
The group project that me and my team made for Web Technologies exam, during the third year of University in Padua. The team included three members: me (Giulia Cor√≤), Marco Pozza and Alessandro Marani. 

It's an XHTML strict website, focusing on accessibility and usability, rather than on cool features. The website is in fact entirely accessible with the use of a screen reader, and the color scheme is chosen so that the site can still be clearly visible from people affect by the most commons kinds of colour-blindness. 
All HTLM and CSS code has been validated by W3C validators, and the website will work fine even with JavaScript disabled in your browser, because the checks on the form inputs are done both by JavaScript and PHP. 

More informations about the project can be found in the file _relazioneProgetto.pdf_ (in Italian).
