# WebTechnologies-LLSIF (Love Live School Idol Festival)
The group project that me and my team made for Web Technologies exam, during the third year of University in Padua. The team included three members: me (Giulia Cor√≤), Marco Pozza and Alessandro Marani. 

It's an XHTML strict website, focusing on accessibility, in fact it is entirely accessible with the use of a screen reader. 
All HTLM and CSS code has also been validated by W3C validators. 

More informations about the project can be found in the file _relazioneProgetto.pdf_ (in Italian).
